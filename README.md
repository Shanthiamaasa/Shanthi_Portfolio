## Hackathon:
### [Refactored@JNTU - Hackathon - March 2018](https://github.com/Shanthiamaasa/jntu_hackathon#refactoredjntu---hackathon---march-2018)

### We are group of 3 and Problem Statement we have worked on:

### Problem: Bitcoin Price Analysis

Historic price of bitcoins are provided for analysis. Your task is to 

1. Ingest the data into a format that is easy for analysis.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
3. Can you predict the future price of the dataset? 

#### 1.1 Time-Series Analysis

Here is an example of time series analysis on Arctic Sea Ice that you can use for your own analysis.

# [Project 1: Visualization-on-COVID-19-Data](https://github.com/Shanthiamaasa/Visualization-on-COVID-19-Data/edit/master/README.md)

 Coronaviruses (CoV) are an enormous group of infections that cause sickness starting from the normal virus to progressively extreme ailments. Coronaviruses can be transmitted among creatures and individuals. The infection, which was first found in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic [1]. The official name has been given by WHO as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). This virus has spread rapidly from one city to the whole world, analysis and visualization of the coronavirus data help to know the spread of the disease and to gain insights.


# [Project 2: H1-B-Data-analysis-Using-Hadoop](https://github.com/Shanthiamaasa/H1-B-Data-analysis-Using-Hadoop)

 The H1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, Ph.D.) and work in a full-time position. We will be performing analysis on the H1B visa applicants between the years 2011-2016. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate by using Hadoop concepts, how data generated from datasets can be mined and utilized to make targeted, real time and informed decisions.


# [Project 3: Opinion mining on Alexa Using Ontology](https://github.com/Shanthiamaasa/opinion-mining)

The ideology of the web has altered and many changes took place in this so called Internet called social web. Each and every user is aware of technologies and the social web, people are totally sticking in online using internet and now-a-days shopping is done on online websites where the orders come home without risk, When ordering online by seeing images is difficult so, there are reviews where the customers give the rating when a product is bought under that product. People are more interested in rating and reviews than believing the pictures where opinion ming comes into the picture. In opinion mining, the unorganized data is organized and put it in a good order and find polarity so that customers feel easy shopping, but in opinion mining there are missing semantic relations and less features extraction so as we get into the ontology which helps to get more hidden aspects and features with the semantic relations in an order.
